## Work Experience

__Machine Learning Engineer__ - __Xiaoniu Animation__  Shenzhen, China `2018/01 - 2019/05` 
Developed a recommentaion microservice with a pioneer use of deepwalk in production and greatly improved user CTR and retention rates. Invented a new graph search algorithm which is much faster than other products on the market. Built and helped maintain the ETL and CI/CD pipeline of the company. (Spark, Scala, Kafka, Hadoop, Hive, Docker, GO, Python, Arangodb, Airflow)

__Research Intern__ - __Thales__  Québec, QC, Canada `2017/05 - 2017/12` 
Built a semantic search engine helping the HR department find specific experts. It combines graph database with machine learning (graph embedding) and NLProc (chatbot). The final product allows a HR to input a natural sentence describing the desired expertise in the portal and generate proper candidates. (Neo4j, Docker,  React, Flask, Tensorflow)

__Research Intern__ - __City Government__  Québec, QC, Canada `2016/05 - 2016/09` 
Built a pdf table extraction tool for techinical documents of soil protection and rehabilitation. The tool achieved a STOA result of 91% recall and 77% precision. (Java, Kotlin, Python)

__Software Developer__ - __HSBC Software Development__  Guangzhou, China `2014/01 - 2015/01` 
Developed several tools (reporting/analysis) for traders across APEC region. Helped supporting other legacy tools. (Java, VBA, Access, Oracle, Bash, Python)

__Game Developer & Mathematician__ - __HugenStar Game__ Guangzhou, China `2012/01 - 2014/01` 
Designed the economy and assisted development of a mobile fighting game which ranked top 10 games on apple store with 4 million players. （Unity3D, VBA, Excel, Matlab, Python）

## Research Projects
[__Question  Answering and Generation__](https://github.com/PythaGorilla/QAQG/)  
Using large language model to mine question answer pairs from text

[__Machine Learning framework in Unity__](https://github.com/PythaGorilla/Artificial_life/)  
A machine learning bot framework in Unity that communicates controlled by outside signals.

[__Contextual Suggestion__](https://bitbucket.org/mojians/contextual-suggestion)  
A recommender system which is the first to use word embeddings.
